# Legday
A calculator and resource hub for leg training

## Details
1. The main feature of the leg day web application is the calculator. It takes in two parameters from the user. Their overall height in inches and their femur length in inches. 
2. Using a function I created, it passes these parameters into a formula which measures their height to femur length ratio. This in turn alerts the user as to whether they are an 'optimal squatter' or 'sub-optimal squatter'. 
3. Armed with this information, the user can then navigate to the section of the site that suits their style of training, i.e. Bodybuilding or Powerlifting, and see which leg movements are best for their structure and goals.
4 The site also features a section called 'Gear' which offers suggestions, information and links for equipement to use to get the most out of ones leg training experience.
